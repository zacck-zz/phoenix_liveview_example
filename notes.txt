Simple Phoenix Application

This application assumes that one has a working elixir installation set up on the machine running it.


1. To setup the application run the following in it's root folder
`mix deps.get`

This installed the requisite dependencies needed for the application


2. To run the application and use it run the following command

`iex -S mix phx.server`


This runs the application and it should be accessible at

http//localhost:4000


The application provides a form to enter a url to be shortened, which it shall validate
and if satisfacory provide a shortened url that will redirect on to their original Url


Due to time I did  not set up a non volatile database for the application, I instead used
erlang's inbuilt term storage which will be deleted everytime the application is restarted.

Again in the interest of time I used only phoenix to build the whole application, using
Phoenix's Liveview for the frontend and a simple Genserver for the persistence of the provided Urls


I focused on having most of the applications functionality covered with unit tests albeit I avoided
testing some tricky usecases


Time: I spent around 5 hours building the application.
